# hello-world
first timer stuff

New to pretty much all of this stuff, not even sure where to begin. Lost job due to Corona, no real options to fall back on. Need to pave a way forward.
Willing to make a change in my life, even though this is very challenging. Determined to mak  and  provide a better path for myself. 
Love music, photography, and am currently self teaching myself to play the piano as well. 
Know no-one in my inner circle to ask for help, take it easy on a beginner.
